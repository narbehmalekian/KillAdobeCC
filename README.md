# KillAdobeCC
This script forcibly terminates Adobe background tasks, because when you click "Exit Creative Cloud", Adobe decides to run in the background.

<h2>WARNING:</h2> <h3>RUN THIS SCRIPT AT YOUR OWN RISK!</h3>
I haven't tested what happens when this script is run while Photoshop, or other Adobe programs are running, but I imagine it would NOT go well. Please save your work before killing Adobe background tasks.
