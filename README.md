# KillAdobeCC
This script forcibly terminates Adobe background tasks because when you click "Exit Creative Cloud", Adobe thinks you want "Run in the background".

<h2>WARNING:<h2>
I haven't tested what happens when you run this script while you have Photoshop, or another Adobe programs open, but I imagine it would NOT go well. Please save your work before killing background tasks.
  
<h3>The script kills the following tasks:<h3>
  - adobeupdateservice
  - armsvc
  - adobe_licensing_helper
